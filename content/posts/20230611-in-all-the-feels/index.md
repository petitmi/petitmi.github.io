summary: "In all the feels, it's hitting my softest gut. I sit there and thought life is an agony, when I heard the far cry from the great stones. (在所有的感觉中，它击中了我最柔软的内脏。我坐在那里，觉得生活是一种痛苦，这时我听到了大石头上传来的远处的哭声。)"

In all the feels\
it's hitting my softest gut\
I sit there and thought life is an agony\
when I heard the far cry from the great stones

I keep the past sensations reflected\
The past solitude cannot keep me chill but nourished\
Standing in the chaos that your statue faded in\
Suspecting the truth is telling the lie to me
