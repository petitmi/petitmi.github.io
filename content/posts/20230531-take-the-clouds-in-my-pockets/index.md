把云朵揽入口袋里，捏碎了变成许多星辰\
华丽又锋利，就像你曾经说过的话一样\
可这些话越仔细想越想不起来，就像这两年的变化一样\
好像不小，也越仔细想越想不起来

人们说的量变达到质变，可是短短数十年，何以要变，又变了什么？

想象，\
自己是一个符号，在全力冲刺，追着变化跑

再想象，\
在纷扰里光着脚漫步，不用看脚下的每一步路，用皮肤触碰各种表皮

再想象，\
忙碌地同情每一个人，忙碌于呵护和赞美自己

同情一个在别人的期望和自己的期望里，酒后驾驶的人

Take the clouds and tuck them into my pocket, crush them into numerous stars.\
Splendid and sharp, just like the words you once said.\
But the more you ponder these words, the harder they become to recall, much like the changes of these past two years.\
It feels significant, yet the more you ponder, the harder it is to remember.

People say that a quantitative change leads to a qualitative change, but in just a few decades, why must it change, and what has changed?

Imagine,\
Being a symbol, sprinting with all your might, chasing after change.

Imagine once more,\
Strolling barefoot in the midst of chaos, not needing to scrutinize each step, touching all sorts of surfaces with your skin.

Imagine once more,\
Busy sympathizing with every person, busy nurturing and praising oneself.

Sympathizing with someone who, within the expectations of others and their own, drove while intoxicated.
