<!-- ## 夹了青椒的肉夹馍 -->
老李从早上5点就开始忙活了\
搅了搅刚炖上的腊汁肉\
在烤炉上放上揉好的面\
为了这个城市新移民的口味\
他还切起了青椒

他听到两个中学生经过摊位说到：\
“我最受不了肉夹馍里放青椒，\
我去意大利旅游，\
他们也受不了披萨上放菠萝”

他没吃过披萨，但很想试一试\
对面就是一家披萨店\
但他从未看过一眼价格\
因为他知道这是“西餐”\
都是糊弄人的哩

想起前两年还在中学附近卖菠萝\
那时候的菠萝还是酸的\
就像小时候的一种野果\
爷爷干活儿回来就会给他们摘几颗

他想，如果自己是个意大利人\
他一定把披萨店开到家附近\
而且一定不会放菠萝\
不管外国游客多喜欢吃\
因为意大利人开店不是缺钱\
是为了满足自己的兴趣爱好呢

## Shaanxi Rougamo With Green Peppers
Old Lee has been working since 5:00 am\
Stirring the freshly simmered meat\
Putting the kneaded dough on the grill\
For the taste of the city's new immigrants\
He also cut up green peppers

He heard two high school students pass by the stall and say:\
"I can't stand green peppers in the Rougamo.\
I traveled to Italy,\
where locals can't stand pineapple on pizza either."

He had never eaten pizza, but he wanted to try it.\
There was a pizza place right across the street.\
But he never looked at the prices\
Because he knew it was "Western food"\
It's all a joke.

Two years ago, he was selling pineapples near the high school.\
The pineapple was sour when he was a kid\
It tastes like the wild fruit picked by Grandpa\
every time when he came back from labour 

He thought, if he were an Italian.\
He would have opened a pizzeria near his home\
And he would never put pineapple in it\
No matter how much foreign tourists like to eat\
Because Italians don't open stores for lack of money\
It is to meet their own hobby it
