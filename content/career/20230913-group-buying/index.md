No one could have imagined that a minor news report about unattributed lung inflammation in December would evolve into an unexpected black swan event that would profoundly influence the destiny of humankind. COVID-19 disrupted the forward march of nations and individuals, or perhaps it disrupted the mutual tug-of-war among nations and individuals in a state of standstill.

2019 the year was marked by the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, the Hong Kong protests against the extradition bill, the intensification of the US-China trade war. And of course, there were other significant events in different regions, such as various wars in the Middle East and the devastating fire that consumed the Notre-Dame Cathedral in Paris, among many others. 

In 2019, the year was marked by the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, the Hong Kong protests against the extradition bill, and the intensification of the US-China trade war. Of course, there were other significant events in different regions, such as various wars in the Middle East and the devastating fire that consumed the Notre-Dame Cathedral in Paris, among many others. The Covid-19 outbreak was not strongly correlated with these events, but its effects had a somewhat hidden yet obvious relationship.

In China, people were intermittently confined to their homes on a city-by-city basis for the next three years. People were only allowed to receive food deliveries rather than go outside to pick up food. However, the delivery system was also blocked, so those who delivered essentials to individuals could only do so on behalf of the community. This was the time when group-buying became known throughout China, though it was not the time of its inception.

Working at a major online retail company and focusing on the group-buying business allowed me to witness how group-buying grew during the three years of Covid-19, when people were struggling with city lockdowns and economic devastation.

There are two dominant features in group-buying compared to the online retail model: the first is pre-sale with next-day delivery, and the other is community pickup. Although this model is crucial during special situations like lockdown days, it also works well in normal daily life if the prices are low enough, and the items are diverse and of high quality.
